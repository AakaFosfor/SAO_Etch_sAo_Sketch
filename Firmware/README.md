"OLED_ssd1327_test" is Arduino sample code to activate the OLED screen.

"Supercon.8_Badge_Micropython" are the files needed to run the Etch sAo Sketch with the Supercon 8 Badge using Micropython. Etch-sAo-Sketch goes in the port marked "6". The petal SAO goes in "1" and the touchwheel goes in "2". Sample code provided by Derek Jamison. https://youtube.com/@MrDerekJamison
