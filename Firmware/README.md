# Etch_sAo_Sketch Firmware Examples

The Etch sAo Sketch requires a microcontroller with an I2C bus to run. This folder contains a few examples.

"Etch_sAo_Sketch_V1.0_RP2040_W_Arduino_Demo" is designed to work with the SAO Demo Controller, or any RP2040-based board. It provides the full drawing functionality for the V1 Etch sAo Sketch.

"Etch_sAo_Sketch_V1.1_RP2040_W_Arduino_Demo" is refined for the V1.1 Etch sAo Sketch which has resistors added in series with the potentiometers to allow full travel of the knobs to map to the full screen. It's a quality of life improvement.

"OLED_ssd1327_test" is Arduino sample code to activate the OLED screen.

"Supercon.8_Badge_Micropython" are the files needed to run the Etch sAo Sketch with the 2024 Supercon.8 and Hackaday Europe 2025 Badges using Micropython. Etch-sAo-Sketch must be plugged into the port marked "6" when the badge boots up. If used, the petal and touchwheel SAOs goes in "1", "2" or "3".

Supercon.8 2024 sample code provided by Derek Jamison.
"If the drawing area is smaller than the size of the screen, change the `calib_` values in `etch_sao_sketch.py` (`calib_left_zero_offset`, `calib_right_zero_offset`, and `calib_voltage_scaling`). The default values **work for meâ„¢**. Shaking the SAO will clear the screen, to turn off this functionality set `enable_shaking = False` in `main.py`."
