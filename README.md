V1.1 - OLED VERSION

Coming soon... Enabling full range of the analog pots via the accelerometer ADC inputs. And a taller male SAO header for easier connection to the main (red) PCBA.

V1.0 - OLED VERSION

ERRATA: The full travel of the analog pots is only available through GPIO1/2 of the SAO port. A reduced range of travel is available through the accelerometer ADC inputs. The included SAO Header pins need to be pushed back into the header body 1 mm so they extend far enough to be connected to the red PCBA after the OLED PCBA is stacked on the bottom.
