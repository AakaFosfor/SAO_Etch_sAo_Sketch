# V1.2 - OLED VERSION

This version is being developed for Hackaday Europe 2025 with a separate repository located here: https://github.com/ageppert/SAO_Sketch

-------------

# V1.1 - OLED VERSION

Coming soon... Refinements to include:
1) Enable full range of the analog pots via the accelerometer ADC inputs.
2) Use a taller male SAO header for easier connection to the main (red) PCBA.
3) Tweak alignment hole size/position for the alignment spheres and OLED position.
Otherwise, it looks and functions just like V1.0.

# V1.0 - OLED VERSION

This version was shared at Hackaday Supercon 2024. It is available for purchase here: https://www.tindie.com/products/36383/

V1.0 ERRATA: The full travel of the analog pots is only available through GPIO1/2 of the SAO port. A reduced range of travel is available through the accelerometer ADC inputs. The included SAO Header pins need to be pushed back into the header body 1 mm so they extend far enough to be connected to the red PCBA after the OLED PCBA is stacked on the bottom.
