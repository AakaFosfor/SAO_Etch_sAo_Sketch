# V1.1 - OLED VERSION

Coming soon... Refinements to include:
1) Enabling full range of the analog pots via the accelerometer ADC inputs.
2) A taller male SAO header for easier connection to the main (red) PCBA.
3) Alignment hole size/position tweaks for the aignment spheres.

# V1.0 - OLED VERSION

<img src="Images/Etch sAo Sketch Thumbnail crop center.jpeg" height="300">

V1.0 ERRATA: The full travel of the analog pots is only available through GPIO1/2 of the SAO port. A reduced range of travel is available through the accelerometer ADC inputs. The included SAO Header pins need to be pushed back into the header body 1 mm so they extend far enough to be connected to the red PCBA after the OLED PCBA is stacked on the bottom.
